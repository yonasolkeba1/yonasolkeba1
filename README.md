Bitcoin analysts give 3 reasons why BTC price below $20K may be a 'bear trap'
MARKET ANALYSIS
Bitcoin (BTC) recovered above the $19,000 mark on Sept. 20, a day after falling to its lowest level in three months.

Bitcoin struggles after dropping below $20K

On the daily chart, the BTC price rose from $18,255 to $19,650. This 7.5% price rebound mirrored similar rebound moves witnessed in the stock market, suggesting that investors have been coming to terms with another significant rate hike by the Federal Reserve expected on Sept. 20‚Äì21.

However, opinions differ on the longevity of Bitcoin's rebound. Independent market analyst Jonny Moe stressed that BTC's ongoing price action is similar to its sideways consolidation moves at the beginning of this year.

In other words, Bitcoin's current price rebounds around the $20,000 mark do not make a long-term bull case.


Rudy Takala, former Fox News executive and opinion editor at Cointelegraph, also warns crypto traders to prepare for more "dark times" due to worsening economic conditions globally.

On the other hand, some analysts believe Bitcoin is staring at a strong bullish reversal in the times ahead. Let's take a closer look at the three optimistic market outlooks.  

Bitcoin prints "bullish hammer"

Bitcoin's Sept. 20 candlestick is a bullish hammer, which suggests weakening downside momentum, according to pseudonymous analyst Trader Tardigrade.

A bullish hammer candlestick forms when the asset drops significantly lower from its opening value but recovers to close near the same level. Traders see the hammer as a sign of bearish rejection, given its history of preceding market bottoms. 

Trader Tardigrade applies the same theory to Bitcoin's recovery move on Sept. 20, noting that its bullish hammer may usher in a reversal.


Pi-Cycle bottom

Another technical signal that anticipates Bitcoin to rebound sharply is the Pi-Cycle bottom.

Specifically, the open-source indicator tracks two long-term simple moving averages (SMAs): the 471-day SMA and the 150-day EMA. History shows that Bitcoin price bottoms out for the market cycle when the 150-day SMA crossed below the 471-day SMA.

Meanwhile, the price heads for a strong bullish reversal in the days leading up to and after the 150-day SMA closes above the 471-day SMA. Pseudonymous analyst, Titan of Crypto, highlighted that Bitcoin is eyeing a 150-471 SMA bullish crossover sometime by 2023.

"1st cross occurred in July," he noted, adding:

"2nd cross is yet to occur. Reversal might be closer than we think."
Wyckoff Cycle

Aurelien Ohayon, the CEO of investment strategy firm XOR Strategy, anticipates Bitcoin to reach $45,000 by early 2023, arguing that BTC price has been following the popular Wyckoff Cycle pattern.

A Wyckoff Cycle has four phases: accumulation, markup, distribution and markdown. After the markdown phase, the cycle repeats with the accumulation phase, which, as Ohayon points out, is the case with Bitcoin's ongoing price rebound.

"Bitcoin is entering the Final Bullish Phase of the Wyckoff Cycle," the analyst concludes.

XRP price breaks out of range with a 25% rally, but why?
MARKETS NEWS
Crypto markets are flashing a bit of green on Sept. 22 as Bitcoin (BTC) price tacked on a 4.7% gain to trade above $19,300 and Ether (ETH) surged 6.5% to recapture the $1,300 level. 

RSR and Astar Network (ASTAR) also surged by 23% and 17% respectively, but the more notable mover of the day was XRP.

Currently, XRP price reflects a near 25% gain and the asset is up 41% in the past month. According to defense lawyer James K. Filan, on Sept. 18, Ripple Labs filed a motion for summary judgment ‚Äî a legal process that involves the court making a final decision based on the provided facts, rather than ordering a trial ‚Äî and a decision on whether XRP is a security is expected by mid-December.

From the perspective of technical analysis, XRP price is looking to secure a second daily close above a longterm descending trendline resistance and trading volumes and open interest on futures contracts have risen sharply in the past 24-hours.

According to Cointelegraph market analyst Marcel Pechman:

‚ÄúXRP‚Äôs open interest is now at $575 million up from $310 million just a week ago.‚Äù
Traders who are not yet positioned might consider waiting to see if the 200-day moving average at $0.49 is flipped to support over the next few daily closes. Typically, intraday and swing traders take profit at longer term resistance levels and they also anticipate price rejections and lower support retests after an asset manages a breakout from a period of long consolidation, price bottom or a market structure-altering move.

Crypto analytics data provider TheKingfisher drove a similar point by suggesting that buyers would ‚Äúlikely have an opportunity to long XRP lower.‚Äù
